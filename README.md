# üåë Poetic Prologue for Livecoding

Before we start, I want to share something with you.

When you learn to code, it feels like unlocking a superpower.  
Suddenly, the world becomes code ‚Äî and code becomes possibility.

You can build systems that listen, that think, that respond.  
You can turn on lights with an algorithm, make machines dream,  
touch reality through a single line of text.

Programming gives you the feeling that **anything** can be created.

But over time, that superpower is often domesticated.  
We trap it into schedules, into tickets and deadlines,  
into software that serves metrics, sales, and monthly fees.

Slowly, the creative spark fades.  
Those ‚Äúfree hours‚Äù arrive already exhausted,  
and the flame that once wanted to change the world  
begins to shrink.

And then, live coding appears.

A reminder.  
A portal.  
A return.

Live coding invites us to reclaim code as play,  
as art, as voice, as pulse.

Here, code doesn‚Äôt serve a boss or a KPI.  
Here, nothing is billed ‚Äî  
**here, it is felt.**

Here, errors become improvisation.  
Glitches become texture.  
Bugs become unexpected music.

Live coding is using our ‚Äúsuperpower‚Äù not to produce,  
but to **create**.  
To connect.  
To imagine.

And the most beautiful part:  
the tools we use were not born in corporations.  
They were built by people who create for the joy of creating,  
who share so that others may ignite their own spark.

Tonight, the code you‚Äôll see  
is not a product ‚Äî it is a ritual.

A conversation between my mind, my hands, and this moment.  
An improvisation that exists **only here**, **only now**.

If anything you hear or see tonight moves you, remember this:

There is also a creative fire inside you,  
waiting to return.

Welcome.

Let us begin.
